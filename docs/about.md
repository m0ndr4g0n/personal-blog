# about

my name is leonardo and i have been working as sysadmin/devops for almost two years, at the same time i worked as php developer for a little less than a year.<br></br>

over that time i discovered my passion for cybersecurity and started to study some topics like penetration tests, threat intelligence and red teaming.<br></br>

currently focusing my studies in C, assembly and computer architecture and suddenly i thought it would be a good idea to gather my studies in a blog.<br></br>

feel free to contact me on discord if you find any errors here or just want to talk about something, my user is "crk0\_".<br></br>
